# hello-world
[Verse 1]
Deep in my heart there's a fire burning hard
Deep in my heart there's desire for a start
I'm dying in emotion, it's my world in fantasy
I'm living in my, living in my dreams

[Chorus: solo and falsetto choir]
You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever, stay with me together
You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know

[Verse 2]
Let's close the door and believe my burning heart
Feeling alright, come on, open up your heart
I keep the candles burning, let your body melt in mine
I'm living in my, living in my dreams

[Chorus: solo and falsetto choir]
You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever, stay with you together

You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know
You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know
You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know
You're my heart, you're my soul...
